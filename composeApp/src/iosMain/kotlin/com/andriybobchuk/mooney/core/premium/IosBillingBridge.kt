 *
 * StoreKit 1 (`SKPaymentQueue` / `SKProduct`) is deprecated on iOS 26 and has
 * been the source of two App Store rejections (Submission 1f7ed921):
 *  - iPad popover presentation could crash with no `sourceView`
 *  - The observer-based callback model can silently drop transitions when
 *    the bridge between SKPaymentTransactionObserverProtocol and Kotlin
 *    coroutines doesn't deliver
 *
 * StoreKit 2 in Swift uses native `async/await` and returns a single Result
 * per call — much harder to lose, and Swift owns the UI presentation so
 * iPad layout issues never surface in Kotlin.
 *
 * Callbacks are used (not suspend functions) because Kotlin/Native cannot
 * call Swift `async` functions directly; the Kotlin side wraps each callback
 * in a `suspendCancellableCoroutine` to expose a suspend API to the rest of
 * the app.
